  "summary": "The diff shows `LanguageProvider` being imported into `frontend/src/App.tsx`, but the provided truncated snippet does not include the part of the render tree where the provider would wrap the router/component tree. Therefore, it’s not possible to confirm from the diff summary alone that the React tree is actually wrapped in `LanguageProvider` to eliminate the runtime error.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure the React component tree is wrapped in `LanguageProvider` so any call to `useLanguage()` (e.g., in `frontend/src/App.tsx` and `frontend/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`) is always within provider context, eliminating the runtime error \"useLanguage must be used within a LanguageProvider\".",
      "reason": "Although `LanguageProvider` is imported in `frontend/src/App.tsx`, the truncated diff snippet does not show the JSX where the provider wraps the application/router tree; thus the core requirement cannot be verified as implemented from the available evidence.",
