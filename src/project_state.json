    "Project name: PrimePost.",
    "Clients: Flutter mobile apps (Customer + Store Owner/Worker) for iOS/Android; React web app for Admin dashboard.",
    "Backend options discussed: Node.js + Express or Firebase; database Firestore or PostgreSQL.",
    "System requirements: secure auth + RBAC, cloud database, GPS/location support, push notifications, scalable architecture.",
    "Real-time updates required (Firebase realtime mechanisms or WebSockets).",
    "Payments: Mobile Money integration (e.g., MTN, Orange).",
    "Note: mentions 'floater technology' as a build constraint/requirement (unclear definition).",
    "Auth direction change: users should sign up with name/phone/email and use a persistent 4-digit PIN, with optional biometric (fingerprint/Face ID) support for login and transaction confirmation (not Internet Identity-only).",
    "Add admin-managed Terms & Conditions documents (separate for Customer and Store Owner apps) and require first-login acceptance for customers.",
    "Biometric/WebAuthn prompts must be non-blocking: always allow Skip, handle cancel/failure/success by closing the modal and continuing the flow; apply consistently across all app roles (Customer, Owner/Worker, Admin)."

  "known_issues": [
    "Login/onboarding can get stuck on the biometric enablement popup: Skip button non-responsive and fingerprint prompt completion does not advance; reported across Customer, Owner/Worker, and Admin experiences (notably on Android/WebAuthn).",
    "Regression/bug: login flow stops after entering password (does not continue) across all roles (Store Owner/Worker, Admin, Customer) and persists across different browsers; users cannot access any app area.",
    "Customer Terms & Conditions acceptance screen reports \"Terms and Conditions are not yet available\" even though Terms & Conditions text was provided and expected to be published/available.",
    "Production launch/deployment failed with a deployment error (needs investigation to restore production deployment pipeline).",
    "Admin login flow is incorrectly blocked by Terms & Conditions availability/acceptance (shows \"Terms and Conditions is not available\" for Admin, but Admin should not need T&C)."
